### JSON x SUNBIBLE

as of April 2025 sunbible uses html, I plan to make the move to making a ui that uses this json database. I also want to make this database more accesable over the blockchain and over ipfs.

I want to thank  Arul John making this json database and putting it on github.

how i might use it in my ui
- give every word an id
- create a red letter json

---

### Who needs an api
when you have the data?
this json contains mininmal data, but for my ui i will be giving every word an id, up to you to decide what id fromat you want to use. but here is an id fromat that i plan to use

b1c1v1w1 = genesis 1:1 word 1

my ui will probably have a lot of code to help define the id's and get the data from this json.
