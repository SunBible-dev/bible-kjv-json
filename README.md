### JSON x SUNBIBLE

as of April 2025 sunbible uses html, I plan to make the move to making a ui that uses this json database. I also want to make this database more accesable over the blockchain and over ipfs.

I want to thank  Arul John making this json database and putting it on github.

how i might use it in my ui
- give every word an id
- create a red letter json
