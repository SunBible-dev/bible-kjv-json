### JSON x SUNBIBLE

as of April 2025 sunbible uses html, I plan to make the move to making a ui that uses this json database. I also want to make this database more accesable over the blockchain and over ipfs.

I want to thank  Arul John making this json database and putting it on github.

how i might use it in my ui
- give every word an id
- create a red letter json


### Who needs an api
when you have the data?
this json contains mininmal data, but for my ui i will be giving every word an id, up to you to decide what id fromat you want to use. but here is an id fromat that i plan to use

b1c1v1w1 = genesis 1:1 word 1

my ui will probably have a lot of code to help define the id's and get the data from this json.


### IPFS

```sh
# ipfs car
ipfs-car pack bible-kjv-json --output bible-kjv-json.car
ipfs-car pack red-letters-kjv-json --output red-letters-kjv-json.car

# w3
w3 space use SUNBIBLE
w3 up bible-kjv-json
w3 up red-letters-kjv-json
```
